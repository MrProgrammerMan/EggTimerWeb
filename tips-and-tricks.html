            <h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This website is designed to help you boil a large amount of eggs to different levels of doneness at the same time.</p>
            <h2>Boiling eggs 101</h2>
            <p>1. Boil a large pot of water, enough to cover the eggs. </p>
            <p>2. Place the eggs carefully into the boiling water with a spoon, careful not to crack the eggs.</p>
            <p>3. After having boiled the desired amount of time, place the eggs in cold water. This will stop the boiling and make the shell release more easily.</p>
            <h2>How to use the website</h2>
            <p>There are preset boiling times for small, medium and large eggs. These can be changed by clicking on the cog in the main navigation.</p>
            <p>Here you can generate a link that contains your preferred settings to be saved for next time you need to boil eggs.</p>
            <p>1. Select your size of egg. Try medium if you are unsure.</p>
            <p>2. Use the sliders to select how many eggs you wish to boil and to what doneness-level you want them.</p>
            <p>3. Put the total number of eggs into boiling water and immidiately click 'Start'.</p>
            <p>The website will alert you with a popup every time you need to remove eggs from the water.</p>
            <p>Remove the specified amount of eggs quickly whilst taking care not to spill hot water. Place the eggs in cold water.</p>
            <p>Click 'ok' to remove the popup and repeat until all eggs are boiled.</p>
